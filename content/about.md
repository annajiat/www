**FAIRPoint**s- is an event series bringing together people across the research ecosystem to discuss, highlight, and share pragmatic solutions to making FAIR a reality. 


FAIRPoints in collaboration with <span style="color:blue"> [GoFAIR US](https://www.go-fair.org/)</span>, <span style="color:blue">[SDSC](https://www.sdsc.edu/)</span>, <span style="color:blue">[AGU](https://www.agu.org/)</span>, and <span style="color:blue">[SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data)</span> aims to enhance community building and knowledge sharing across diverse **geographic** and **domain areas** in order to cultivate researchersâ€™ engagement in **FAIR** on a global scale.

## Our main aims are to:
* Provide a **platform for FAIR conversations** featuring the latest developments from the community
* Highlight **use-cases and how-to-approaches** addressing FAIR implementation from researchers and research support staff perspectives
* Capture and share the discussion outcomes in **pragmatic, bite-sized lesson material** with integrated schemas
* Make FAIR more **accessible** to broader audiences 
* Explore FAIR practices from a **global** perspective
 

This event series will feature the work done around FAIR implementation across our collaborating organizations, cultivate engagement and relationships between researchers **on all levels**, data service providers, policy-, decision makers and organization members in response to rapid scientific progress, as well as foster the development of impactful and more globally connected **FAIR solutions**.
