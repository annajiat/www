# FAIRPoints
We take a pragmatic approach to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. First, we gather special topics (particularly challenges) regarding FAIR from the research community and identify speakers for those topics.

Second, we work with the speakers on focusing their talks to address the top points that the community should know about, be prepared for, and respond to. Third, we convert the points into machine readable, search engine optimized, and accessible guides that are quick and easy to review and understand.

Throughout the process, our goal is to include diverse voices, support equitable access, provide for many languages, and work towards compensating volunteer efforts.
